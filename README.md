## Usage

To create a local MySql database, I have used XAMPP for this. The default name is "flixingdb", but you could use a different name if you edit the file HibernateUtil.java. Database credentials are stored in system variables, so you need add them as well.

Then you need you clone the project and run a MAVEN package command in order to get an runnable jar file. A different option is just use your preferred IDE for running the project.


## Features

 #### - Unitary Testing with JUnit 5 and Mockito using an H2 in-memory database

 #### - DAO and MVC patterns adopted

 #### - Dependency injection and Clean Code respected

 #### - Used Sonarqube community for checking the project

 #### - HibernateUtil configured programmatically 

 #### - Hibernate validator included

 #### - MySql Database Schema
